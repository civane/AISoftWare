Bug Description:Integer overflow in the primality loop condition. The code uses divisor * divisor <= number with divisor an int and number a long; divisor*divisor is evaluated as int and can overflow for large divisor values, making the loop stop too early and causing some composite large numbers to be treated as prime.

Bug Location: Line 7

Suggested Patch:
- for (int divisor = 5; divisor * divisor <= number; divisor += 6)
+ for (int divisor = 5; (long) divisor * divisor <= number; divisor += 6)
Force the multiplication to be done in long to avoid overflow

Fixed Version:
public class Solution {
    private boolean checkPrime(long number) {
        if (number < 2) return false;
        if (number == 2 || number == 3) return true;
        if (number % 2 == 0 || number % 3 == 0) return false;
        
        for (int divisor = 5; (long) divisor * divisor <= number; divisor += 6) {
            if (number % divisor == 0 || number % (divisor + 2) == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
